# static-website-on-s3-AWS
🌐 Static Website on AWS with Terraform

This project provisions a secure static website hosting environment on AWS using Terraform.
The infrastructure uses Amazon S3, CloudFront, Route 53, and ACM to deliver content over HTTPS with a custom domain.

🚀 Features
1. Amazon S3 – stores static website files (HTML, CSS, JS).
2. CloudFront (with OAC) – serves content securely with caching and HTTPS.
3. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) – provides SSL/TLS certificates.
4. Amazon Route 53 – manages DNS records for a custom domain.
5. Terraform IaC – fully automated infrastructure deployment.
